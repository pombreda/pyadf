pyadf is a pure python module (using ctypes) that allows access to Amiga disk images from Python it relies on ADFlib.

pyadf provides:

  * pyadf.adflib - ctypes wrapper on ADFlib - this was generated by [ctypesgen](http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/)
  * pyadf - a Pythonic "easy" api to ADF images

ADFlib is maintained by Laurent Clevy. For more details see http://lclevy.free.fr/adflib and http://sourceforge.net/projects/adflib

pyadf currently targets Python 2.4-2.6, known to work with the CVS version of ADFlib version 0.7.10 and 0.7.11a (under Windows). Pre-built Windows (XP) DLL available under [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/pyadf/downloads/list). You may choose to build ADFLib manually, see [BuildingADFlib](BuildingADFlib.md).

pyadf has not yet been tested with 0.7.12.

Requires a pre-built shared library (DLL under Windows) of adflib

This project was produced with http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen (ctypesgen is not required to use pyadf).

For other ADFlib projects see RelatedProjects.

For roadmap, and to do items see [Ideas](Ideas.md).
