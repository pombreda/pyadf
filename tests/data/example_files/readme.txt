ADF test data - a selection of directories and files (some small, some medium).

 * Some with spaces in the file name
 * Some with mixed cases file names
 * Nested directories
 * Small sized files
 * Medium sized files (test buffer lengths in get/put file)
 * Text files
 * Binary files
 * Maximum file name length
 * Longer than maximum file name length
 * Currently only a small mix of date/times
 * etc.

Test files/dirs should be put into an disk on a real Amiga and
then converted to ADF.

My Amiga is still in storage after the last time I converted some disks to
ADF so this will probably be done in an emulator.

Aim is to test pyadf (not to test ADFLib).

Can also use pyadf to generate ADF and then test with an (emulator) Amiga.
